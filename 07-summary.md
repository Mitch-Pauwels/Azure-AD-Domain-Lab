# 📦 Project Summary & Key Takeaways

## 📝 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a fully functional, real-world Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment using Azure virtual machines. It covers everything from infrastructure provisioning to file sharing and GPO deployment — simulating a typical IT enterprise setup.

---

## 🔨 What Was Built

- ✔️ **Azure Infrastructure**: Resource Group, Virtual Network, Domain Controller, and a client VM
- ✔️ **Active Directory Domain Services**: Domain setup, OU structure, users, groups
- ✔️ **Group Policy**: Automated network drive mapping using item-level targeting
- ✔️ **File Sharing**: Secure departmental shares with NTFS and share-level permissions
- ✔️ **Remote Desktop Access**: Role-based RDP permissions
- ✔️ **Troubleshooting Documentation**: Real-world examples and debugging strategies

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

| Category                | Skills Demonstrated |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | VM provisioning, VNet setup, IP configuration |
| **AD DS**                | Domain creation, OU design, group/user management |
| **File Sharing**         | Permissions (NTFS + Share), ABE, access control |
| **GPOs**                 | Drive mapping, item-level targeting, policy scoping |
| **Security**             | Role-based access, delegation, RDP permissions |
| **Troubleshooting**      | gpresult, gpupdate, event logs, group targeting |

---

## 💡 Important notes

- **Don’t forget to link GPOs to all relevant OUs** — group membership alone isn’t enough.
- **NTFS and Share permissions are cumulative** — both need to allow access.
- **Test with multiple user types** to simulate real company structure and permissions.
- **RDP access must be explicitly granted** — not all domain users should have it.

## ✅ Completion Status

🎉 Project complete! This setup demonstrates the foundational skills required for IT Help Desk, Systems Administration, and Network Support roles. The environment can be expanded to include:

- DNS/DHCP management
- Print Server configuration
- WSUS deployment
- Monitoring with WMI/Event Logs

---

## 📎 Next Steps (Future Updates)

- Automate this deployment using **Terraform** or **ARM templates**
- Integrate with **Azure AD Connect** for hybrid identity
- Implement **PKI/Certificates** for secure authentication and encryption
- Add real helpdesk scenarios (e.g., password reset scripts, GPO lockdowns, etc.)
