# 🏢 Active Directory Lab in Azure

This project simulates a real-world **enterprise IT environment** in **Microsoft Azure**, demonstrating my ability to deploy, configure, and manage a production-style **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** infrastructure from scratch. The lab includes user account management, secure file sharing, Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and domain-joined clients.

---

### 🎯 Objective

Build a cloud-based IT infrastructure that mirrors a corporate environment, featuring:

- Domain Controller (Windows Server 2022) and Client (Windows 10)
- Fully functional **Active Directory** with OUs, users, and security groups
- **Group Policy** for drive mapping, RDP access, and targeted configuration
- Static IP addressing, custom DNS, and VM provisioning in Azure
- File shares with **NTFS permissions** and **access-based enumeration**

---

### 💼 Why It Matters

In enterprise IT, Active Directory and Group Policy are foundational for managing users, devices, and security. This lab simulates the responsibilities of an **IT Support Specialist** or **System Administrator**, showing my readiness to support real-world infrastructure and deliver secure, scalable IT services.
