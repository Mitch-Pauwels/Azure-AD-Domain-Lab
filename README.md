# Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Lab Project

This project demonstrates setting up a production-style Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment within Microsoft Azure, including:

- Deploying a Domain Controller (DC) and client Windows 10 VM
- Configuring DNS and static IP for the DC
- Creating Organizational Units (OUs), users, and groups
- Setting up file shares with NTFS and share permissions
- Applying Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for mapped network drives and access controls
- Connecting domain-joined clients and testing access and remote desktop
